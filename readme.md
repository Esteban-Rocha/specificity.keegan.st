# Specificity Calculator Web App

A web app for calculating the [specificity of CSS selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#specificity).

The engine for calculating the specificity is a standalone JavaScript module which has its own GitHub repo: https://github.com/keeganstreet/specificity

That module is included as a Git submodule in this web app.
